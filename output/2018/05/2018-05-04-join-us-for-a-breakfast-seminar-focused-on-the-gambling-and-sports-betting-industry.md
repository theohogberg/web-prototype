### Let us show you how to use data science for personalisation and recommendations to improve the experience for your customers.

Customer retention is one of the key considerations for most companies driven by the fact that retaining customers is far cheaper than new customer acquisition. 

In this seminar we will explore how data science can help you with customer retention by giving you insight into your customers’ behaviour and provide you with recommendations on how to interact with them allowing you to personalise and optimise the user experience for each individual customer.

We will show you how to work with the data you have and look at real life use cases from the gambling and sports betting industry showing you the results optimised use of customer data can drive.

_The seminar and case studies will be presented in English by Nenad Bozic, CEO and co-founder of our data science partner company SMARTCAT._

The seminar is on Tuesday 15th May and breakfast will be served.
