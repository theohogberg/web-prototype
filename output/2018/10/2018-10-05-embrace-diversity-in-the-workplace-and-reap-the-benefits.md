In an ever-changing world where it becomes easier every day to travel and relocate and where society rapidly becomes increasingly multicultural, it is more important than ever to truly appreciate diversity and embrace inclusiveness.

At Glomo I have seen first-hand the positive impact diversity has on business. We have every continent represented and more than 60% of our team were born outside Sweden. Each individual comes with different experiences, culture, and language. Embracing the differences and opening up to different points of view allows us to think outside the box, to be open to new opportunities, which in turn drives innovation.  

Employees from diverse backgrounds bring individual skills and experiences which increases creativity leading to an openness and ability to create innovative solutions allowing the business to adapt quicker to fast growing markets and customer demands.

As with most things, there are a few challenges to look out for. The perception of cultural and language barriers as well as resistance to change must be overcome for diversity and inclusiveness to part of the backbone of an organisation.

Encourage employees to express their ideas and opinions and foster an attitude of openness and equal value to reap the benefits of a diverse workforce.
