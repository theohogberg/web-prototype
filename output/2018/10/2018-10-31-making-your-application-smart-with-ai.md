Considering the amount of AI products already in the mainstream tech, it is no doubt that AI is here to stay for a long time.

But what are the features of AI and how can existing web applications benefit from it?

While it is fashionable to have AI features enabled in your application, there are numerous values AI can add which includes:

 

#1. Image recognition

This enriches your application with image analysis capabilities such as Object and scene detection. This can be useful in searching and sorting large datasets of images. It can be used in identity recognition applications where users can scan identity cards or credit cards via web cameras.

Facial analysis is also possible with image recognition. For instance, Facebook’s face recognition application can identify an individual out of 800 million other pictures with 98% accuracy in five seconds. That's astonishing! Other use cases are Celebrity recognition and Text in image. Text in image can be used to extract text from an image.

 

#2. Video analysis

This will allow your application to detect activities and track objects,

 

#3. Text to speech

This can be used to greet users and aid accessibility in your application.

 

#4. Language translation

This can help your website be rendered in several languages and also help with customer support enquiries to lower the language barriers in communication.

 

#5. Speech to text

This can be used to create transcript of phone conversation in telephony and can also analyse speech content of video clips.

 

#6. Text comprehension

Detects key phrases, entities, languages, and sentiment.

Text comprehension can be used for analysing social media comments or user enquiries to get an idea what people are talking about so you can make informed decisions based on the sentiments.

It can also organise text content using the topic modelling method. This is a way of grouping large datasets of conversations or text into categories. AWS has this type of AI service and it groups the dataset by rating each dataset. For example, a dataset can be rated to have 20% sports, 50% news, and 30% fashion.

 

#7. Chatbots: provide advanced customer support.

This can be used to create automated replies to live conversation with users.  It can also be used to keep users engaged while waiting for agents to become available to chat.

 

**Integrating AI to your application**

There are a lot of AI providers offering a wide range of services. Google CLOUD AI and Amazon AI are one of the major players. Others are: TensorFlow, mxnet, GLUON, and PYTORCH.

Adding AI to your application may be as simple as making API calls to a third party service. There is also an opportunity for advanced developers to setup their own AI infrastructure and train datasets to suit their needs.

Amazon AI, for example, offers its AI services in three tiers depending on your level of skills and choice of development. the three tiers are; Application services, Platform services, frameworks & Infrastructure services.
