Extra time can bring in about a third of the total amount of bets placed in one single sporting event.

Engagement from the betting audience is the leading star when defining bet offers. This goes for vendors as well as sportsbook providers. While the entire betting phenomenon circulates around the prediction of an event of any kind, it is of course nearly impossible for any side of the table to forecast revenue.

What can be noted though, is the pure effectiveness of betting engagement that is brought during extra time, for instance. These sometimes decisive minutes tend to bring out the very most of excitement and engagement, further resulting in more daring speculations (and of course, bets brought to the bet slip).

Recent data brought to the GLOMO team shows how more than a third of an event’s betting revenue actually is made during overtime. For a sportsbook operator of any kind, it is thus of great importance to make these crucial minutes as attractive as possible.

Indicators like these trigger us at GLOMO to the very most.

Therefore, we have now extended our offer in our very own “Live-in-Match” widget released previously this year, with an extra time feature. The widget allows users to follow a timeline of an ongoing event, and place bets of different kinds throughout the time of the event – and now also further into overtime sessions.

“Live-in-Match” is a licensed sports betting widget of our very own, available for any actor within the sports betting industry.

Have you got yourself a very exciting idea about how to catch the extra time excitement and convert it into a revenue boost? Share your ideas with us!
