Betting on the player rather than the game is an excellent way of keeping one’s audience stimulated – and loyal.

Betting has become more personalized in terms of player achievements, and a sportsbook of today is not fully complete without player specific bet offers. Today’s betting audience wants to place bets on favourite players, a team’s wildcard or on newcomers.

Pre-match or live, the player focused bet offers run warm and has shown to be an excellent boost for revenue and differentiation among sports betting actors. The more data provided, the better. It’s about presenting the opportunity of showing off a customer’s skills and overall knowledge about the sport. And as a sportsbook operator, it is really about showing respect for one’s users.

Any sportsbook operator (and of course, sportsbook provider) of today should thus consider the fact that player specific bet offers should get enough attention. This applies for the amount and quality of the data supporting the bet, but also in terms of UX, prioritizing the right position and overall UX, of these bet offers.

Sound interesting? Take a look at GLOMO’s very own “Player Specials” widget for inspiration, a licensed widget available for any actor within the sports betting industry.
