##### **Meet us in NYC to discuss the serious business of sport!**

Sports wagering is our core and the European market our main territory. But as the US market is successively being de-legislated, we’re looking forward to meeting a brand new audience and help our partners identify business opportunities therein.

New sports, new customer segments, and new user patterns to exploit are on the agenda when parts of the GLOMO team are paying a visit to NYC for one week starting today.

What has brought us over the Atlantic Sea is, of course, the ICE Sports Betting USA conference taking place 27-28 November in central NYC.

In between scheduled activities with business friends and partners of ours, we are more than happy to share our expertise from the sports wagering industry with curious minds of any kind.

Werther interested in what has been trending in existing markets for the last couple of years, or simply what to consider when defining wagering offers in a brand new sportsbook – let us know and we’ll schedule a coffee to discuss things further! 

As long as the topic is sports-related, we’ll find a slot in our calendars. Because we do know the serious business of sport.
