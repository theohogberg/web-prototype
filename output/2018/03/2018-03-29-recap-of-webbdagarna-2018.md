_Did you miss Webbdagarna in Stockholm last week? Or were you there but missed taking notes while being busy mingling around with potential partners, customers or other nerds just like you? Say no more. GLOMO gives you a recap of what was being said and by whom. Take five minutes to read this through and you can fool anyone (even your boss who payed for your participation), that you were truly there and got it all right!_

Here’s what happened:

**MAIN THEMES**

**Overall Consensus of the Year:** An overarching theme about human beings’ role in new technology. Techniques such as AI, AR, and VR will bring us into a smarter, faster, better, and more optimized future - just like technology always has. That being said, one should be aware of the fact that technology is not here to replace us, but to complement us, so that we can focus on doing what we do best. That is, being human.

**Buzzword of the Year:** Troll farms, followed by an ongoing ping pong game of discussing who is responsible for what in contemporary web climates.

**Reminder of the Year:** A kind reminder from futurist speaker and author Stefan Hyttfors of that we (you and I) are the ones creating our digital future. And by being aware of the choices we make online, we have a shared ownership of what is to come. What has been created by technology today, is no more than an outcome of what has been made by humankind, including actions as well as inactions. We are the ones controlling technology - not the other way around.

**WHAT WAS TRENDING**

**New Favorite Term:** Thick data, a complementing term to big data. While the latter focus on what is quantifiable, the former keep up with non-quantifiable data such as why we do certain choices, the overall context, and other unknown variables.

**New Main Topic Around the Dinner Table:** Nanotechnology and what it does for us, at this very moment. We find it incredibly intriguing being provided with pure facts, delivered right from the lab, about what the nanotechnology is doing for humankind and planet earth - at this very moment.

**New Squad Goal:** Any squad that includes the incredibly cool Maria Strömme, Professor in nanotechnology at Uppsala University.

**KEY LEARNINGS**

**Most Valuable Advice:** Was the one about making Baby Unicorns, which basically means that you should create new content out of already proven-to-be-appreciated content. Here, the term unicorn referred to as appreciated (as in read, liked, commented, and shared) content on the web. In other words, if one post has shown to be successful, you should basically just redo it, but from another angle or with another approach.

**Most Conditioned Critics Toward Swedish Websites:** Conversion expert Karl Gilis made sure to make himself funny over 85 to 90 percent of the audience when stating that Swedes are great at design - but terrible at conversion. And that if you don’t care about words you’re a decorator, not a designer. What was heard from the audience? Silence (of embarrassment).

**Most Lit Though:** Investing in big data is easy but using it is hard.

**THAT FEELING WHEN...**

**TFW #1:** You participate in a #NowWhat hackathon of > 1000 people, trying to concretize what can be done to bring the #MeToo revolution further.

**TFW #2:** You realize that nurses in a maternity clinic are adopting machine learning like pro’s and doing wonders in their daily life, by having a system that analyzes what actions during delivery may cause birth injuries. Who would have thought that nurses in a small clinic in a Swedish middling town would be the precursors of what can be achieved when such technologies meet the institutionalized health care system. The key is to combine machines and humans - to meet the outstandingly best results.

**TFW #3:** You close the Official After Party of Webbdagarna 2018…

**LAST BUT NOT LEAST**

Last but not least, Thank You to IDG and moderator (sorry, disco bowl) Katarina Strömberg for hosting yet another amazing edition of [Webbdagarna](https://webbdagarna.se/event/stockholm/). See you again next year and until then, GLOMO is adding the Sailor Moon Theme to our playlists - and keep making digital transformation happen.
