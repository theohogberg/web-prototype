I was recently asked by a friend to explain the difference between digitalisation and digital transformation. It made me think, frequently people use these terms interchangeably and often digitisation is also thrown into the mix. So, what do these terms really mean and how do they differ?

### **Let’s start with digitisation**

Simply put, digitisation is referring to the creation of a digital version of analogue/physical things. For example, you take meeting notes with pen and paper in your notebook and then transcribe them into an email that you send to your key stakeholders. This is digitisation of the notes. Another example is scanning a document. Digitising doesn’t mean replacing the original it just refers to creating a digital version of it. However, digitising could also refer to automating processes such as taking notes on the laptop or mobile instead of on paper.

### **Having clarified digitisation this leads us on to the next term: digitalisation**

In business, digitalisation most often refers to enabling digital business processes, operations and/or business models by leveraging digital technologies and data. With data being at the centre of digitalisation it enables better engagement and insight, leveraging digitised data and processes. The digitalised workplace is primarily about optimised digital processes and enabling of digital tools which allows improved collaboration and communication which in turn creates new opportunities to engage and allows business to operate anywhere anytime. You can say that digitalisation is, in many ways, the way of moving towards digital business and digital transformation.

### **What then is digital transformation?**

Digitalisation and digital transformation are almost always used interchangeably. Though largely similar, digital transformation is slightly broader than digitalisation and refers to the digitalising of business holistically, often using a digital transformation strategy to change tools and processes to, ultimately, digitalising the entire business model.

### **To summarise**

Digital transformation requires digitalisation in order to create digital business capabilities and it requires digitisation since data (in digital form) is the glue that binds it all together.
