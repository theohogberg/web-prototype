**First things first, what is native app development?**

Native app development refers to creating a version of your product or service specifically for mobile devices such as iPhones and Android devices.

Native apps, compared with websites, are developed for their specific environment which may only run on a limited number of devices. On the other hand, native applications excel at performance. This means that the users experience is improved with faster and more responsive interactions..

In addition to the improvement in performance, mobile devices have a wide variety of features like detecting user’s location, or sensing movement. These features can be used in creative ways in product development to increase the quality of a service.

 

**Is an app the right solution for you?**

If you are running a mobile first service or product, developing a native application is most likely the best option available. Once it’s downloaded, apps are more readily accessible since they live on the user’s home screen, and are reachable with a single tap.

Also when the app is downloaded and given necessary permissions, notifications are also a really powerful communication method with your customers.

 

**iOS, Android or both?**

This really depends on your target audience and business decisions.

If your goal is to reach as many users as you can, building for both iOS and Android is the best option. These two environments cover almost all of the mobile market.

You may want to monetize your app by displaying advertisements, offering in-app purchases or subscriptions, or even selling your application.

You may want to lean towards a specific environment based on your monetization model.

 

**Last but not least - how is a mobile app being developed?**

We can basically separate app development process into three steps.

First, developers program the application, then selected testers make sure that all the features are working as intended, and lastly, you publish the application to your users and gather feedback by collecting the analytics data and meaningfully interpret these results.

A healthy app development cycle continues with these three steps repeatedly, as each cycle improves the quality of the application.
