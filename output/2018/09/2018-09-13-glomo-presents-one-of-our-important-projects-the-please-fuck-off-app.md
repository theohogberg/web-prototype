You should be able to go jogging when you want to. You should be able to take the dog for a walk whenever. You should always be able to make your own way home late at night. But the reality is often very different.

Enough already. Person by person, area by area, city by city – together we create SaferZones™ all over Sweden. To begin with.

The initiators of PFO met the GLOMO team with the idea of creating a world changing app that could help anyone who feels unsafe when being out alone. Said and done. The PFO app is now up and running in the Stockholm area and you can download it from App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android).

Stay tuned and we promise to keep you updated about this fantastic app and the team behind it! Meanwhile, make sure you download the PFO app and read more about this initiative here: [www.pleasefuckoff.org](https://www.pleasefuckoff.org/english/) and on the Facebook page [PFOSweden](https://www.facebook.com/PFOSweden/).
