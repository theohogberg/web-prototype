I’ve been asked to reflect on my experience as a female developer. While Sweden is ranked 5th in the world when it comes to gender equality, the fact that I have been asked to write about this goes to show that perhaps the world of programming and development isn’t representative of this statistic just yet.

My own path to the world of programming isn’t perhaps your typical, linear story. As a child I did not begin writing code at home or spent my free time reading about new technologies. I didn't even study computer science, IT or any programming related field. In fact, I didn’t know how to write a single line of code until a few years ago.

In broad strokes, I spent about 8 years travelling and living in other parts of the world, working in retail, Real Estate and the travel industry. I eventually began working with processing and visualising of geographical data which I then wanted to make more dynamic and accessible. This meant using web technologies to render and serve the data. There were pre-made solutions available but not only did I find these to be pretty flat and poorly designed, but I often wanted to change or add functionality to these visualisations. This led me to one day opening up the devtools in the browser and starting to look at how the page was structured and what controlled its functionality. Intrigued, I started looking at online resources for how I could learn more about this.

I chose to use the courses of Treehouse who in my opinion are very good at teaching programming languages and explaining the logic behind - and best practices of why we might write a certain way over another. Completely hooked and loving the language of programming, I had quickly logged hundreds of hours of coursework and built a number of smaller scale applications. While the online community within programming is a very active and sharing one, after about a year, I felt my skills would benefit from working together with other developers.

I started applying for roles with a lot of companies. I did a lot of interviews and learned a lot through them about what was important and expected of me to know. Something worth noting perhaps to some of you who may think that you need formal education to get a job in programming. For me it was enough being able to demonstrate what I can do (through previous work even if it is just applications that I had built at home), showing a passion for what I do and a desire to learn more and always improve.

I wouldn’t say that I was treated any different in my interviews for developer roles as I was applying for any other job. I felt that I was evaluated on my technical skills and how I might fit in with their current team.

As I now have been working as a developer for a couple of years and been involved in a few different teams I can give personal opinion and answer to what it’s like to be a female developer. Without being able to know what it is like to be a male developer, my guess is that it’s exactly the same. I actually never think about myself or my role in a gender specific way or somehow being different to the guys I work with. I’ll admit, many of my colleagues have commented on that it’s nice to have a woman in the group but other than that, we all spend our days solving problems and exchanging solutions and ideas. I don’t find product owners or managers listening to- or valuing me more or less because of my gender. This may of course differ in countries where perhaps there is generally a bigger separation between men and women in the workplace.

Luckily, development is very much a demonstrable skill and if you have good ambition and do good work, it will not go unnoticed. Our industry is booming and there are so many opportunities and fun projects to work on out there. Gender aside, if You are interested in working in an ever challenging and interesting environment, our industry is welcoming to talented and knowledge hungry people with open arms. We look forward to seeing what you will create!
