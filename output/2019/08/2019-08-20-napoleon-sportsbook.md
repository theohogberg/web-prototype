##### **Before the summer vacations, Napoleon Games launched a new customised sportsbook as a first step to offer a unique sports betting experience.**

GLOMO has contributed with frontend expertise to Napoleon Games since 2018 when World Cup-related widgets were added to the existing sportsbook.

The most recent project with Napoleon Games – [the sportsbook 2.0](https://en-gb.napoleonsports.be/sports/) – began in January 2019, initiated with a kick-off in Belgium that included planning, scope definition and grooming.

A primary goal for this project was to create a new Kambi-based landing page and improve the page’s speed performance. GLOMO has provided the frontend development for the project and implemented improvements such as customised widgets to hide the generic Kambi client, as well as adding new features using data from Kambi and Bettorlogic.

The first launch of [Napoleon Game’s new sportsbook](https://en-gb.napoleonsports.be/sports/) was on May 20th 2019, four months after the first line of code was written. Since the initial launch in May, the GLOMO team has primarily focused on making further performance improvements.

Additionally, GLOMO is currently working on new and exciting features to improve the user experience further. These upcoming features will be available to users in October 2019.
