##### **In mid-August, GLOMO’s new Managing Director Magnus Svanblom entered the building. Now, let’s get to know him a bit!**

##### **Magnus, who is your favourite developer so far? Kidding! What are your initial thoughts about our team?**

Thoughts are that we are truly engaged and keen to deliver value for our clients. Something you can not say about all the firms out there.

##### **We often talk about the GLOMO family and about being a bunch of Glomosapians. What part of our company culture do you like the most?**

I've noticed that we are curious, not just as a good thing when working for our clients but also for all the persons within and related to GLOMO.

I think it is related to the fact that we have colleagues from all the continents (ok, not from Antartica). How can you _not_ be curious with clients and colleagues from across the globe!

##### **How would you describe a Glomosapian with three words?**

Genuine, engaged and curious.

##### **What can we expect from you within the nearest future?**

In short, “more”. More colleagues, more clients, more transparency, more of everything really. The basics are in place, the market is still hot, we just need to do more of what we already do and know.
