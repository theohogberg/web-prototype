##### **While you’ve been lying in the sun listening to podcasts and audiobooks this summer, our computers have been running warm. In mid-July, we released a brand new site for** [**MyBet**](http://www.mybet.com) **as a reintroduction of the brand on the German market.**

The collaboration between MyBet and GLOMO was initiated earlier this year and the first line of code was produced in April. Three months later, the new site was successfully relaunched on the German iGaming market.

MyBet provides a Kambi-based betting experience and the project has been integration heavy, focusing on presenting unique offers in a high-performance fashion.

GLOMO has had full responsibility of bringing the new frontend of the site alive, from brief ideas into a complete solution, with integrations and a wide range of sports and casino offers.

Yet another project within our favourite field – sports betting development – and a chance for us to sharpen our expertise further!

We are very proud of what has been accomplished within just a few months and have, since the launch, kept ourselves busy with an extensive backlog of upcoming improvements and features.
