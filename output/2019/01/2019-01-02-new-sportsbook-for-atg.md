##### **On January 1st, 2019, ATG broadened their offer with a brand new sportsbook developed by GLOMO.**

At the GLOMO office, we are kicking off 2019 together with ATG, for whom we have developed a brand new sportsbook. Due to a Swedish gambling re-regulation that came into force on the first of January this year, the publicly regulated betting provider ATG broadens their offer. Instead of focusing solely on horse racing, they are now offering a complete sports betting experience.

ATG has a tradition of being the leading horse racing company in Sweden, with a customer base of 1 500 000 active users on a yearly basis.

[ATG Sport](https://www.atg.se/sport#home) is a sportsbook powered by Kambi and developed by the GLOMO team. With GLOMO’s expertise in the sports betting industry in general and the Kambi platform in particular, the partnership between ATG and GLOMO has included strategy definition, design and software development.

The dev team has had an intense period from mid-2018 and is now looking forward to similar projects like the one with ATG for 2019.
