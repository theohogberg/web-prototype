##### **One of GLOMO’s most recent projects has been for the publicly regulated gaming provider ATG. During 2018, ATG chose Kambi as their sportsbook platform provider and GLOMO was asked to develop the front-end solution for the upcoming sportsbook.**

A Tech Lead is ultimately responsible for the deliverables from the development team in a project. Angelica, a developer at GLOMO, took on the Tech Lead role for our work with ATG Sport. For this project, her main responsibility was to be the main point of communication between the tech team and the Product Owner. In other words, bringing input and feedback to the development process and testing strategy as well as ensuring the deliverables met ATG's expectations.

We asked Angelica to give us a glimpse of what was happening behind the scenes of this project.

##### **First and foremost, congratulations on a very successful launch! There was a sharp deadline on this project (released at 00.00.01 CET, 01/01/2019), was that a good or bad thing, you would say?**

- Sharp deadlines are always great for bringing focus and productivity to a project but can have a negative effect if expectations are not clear or managed properly. It worked really well in our case as everything we built was broken down into smaller deliverables or MVP’s, allowing us to get feedback quicker and adjust priorities. All of the features that we have built to date will, of course, continue to be iterated on however this approach allowed us to develop quite a large number of features in time for the launch.

##### **What has been most challenging in this project?**

- The most challenging aspect of the project has been some technical difficulties that come with working with a larger organisation and internal IT department as well as understanding the internal policies and processes of the company.

##### **And lastly (before you go back to your code again), what will you bring with you from this experience into future projects?**

- My main takeaways from this project so far have been the strategy we have applied to produce a lot within a short time frame, the importance of a good development cycle and some insights into the pros and cons of the stack that we have used for the project.
