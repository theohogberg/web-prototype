##### **Congratulations on launching an Esports Lobby, accomplishing Napoleon Game’s highly performant sportsbook. What are your thoughts about this project?**

I definitely think it’s an exciting experience to be part of such a growing market as the one of Esports.

##### **What part of the project was the most critical one?**

The key thing of the gaming and gambling business overall is the relevance of data. In practice, this means that we must be careful with caching data, as we are the ones being responsible for delivering the most updated data for the customers.

##### **Are you a gamer yourself?**

I used to be. But I’ve found out that development is much more fun than gaming. So, now I spend my spare time learning new stuff related to coding. My brother-in-law is keen in Counter-Strike though – and now we have one more topic to discuss!

##### **What is on the agenda ahead?**

Adding new features and improving the overall user experience further.
