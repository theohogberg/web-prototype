With some perspective of ICE 2019 and having kickstarted 2019 with the energy from the event our reflections are the following:

- Sportsbetting seems to take over more of the airtime AND floor space. The vivid discussions and hot topics like regulations and licensing and sizzling markets like the US and Germany helps a lot to keep everyone's attention and to create a strong interest.
- eSports betting got an increasing presence in the industry but it is obvious it is still in early stage.  What’s important here is to make sure the more serious players manage to keep the unscrupulous operators away to ensure the business doesn’t get a bad reputation by offering a product to under-aged gamblers. To continue the work being responsible and compliant and still have an attractive offer is key.
- There seems to be an increased level of professionalism with less sexism and half-naked ladies walking around. As we were three ladies from our company attending the event it makes us a bit more comfortable even though it’s not completely removed. Our wish is that the ICE exhibition organisation somehow did a better job and transformed the event to be fully inclusive and professional.

We already look forward to ICE 2020 and what next year event will imply in the context of Sports betting, eSports and if we can walk around without thinking of the colour of others bras.
