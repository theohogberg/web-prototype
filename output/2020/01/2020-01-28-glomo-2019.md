##### We'd like to take the opportunity of summarizing 2019 before we move into 2020 and the many new adventures that this year will bring. 2019 was a year of sports and betting on sports. Below is a summary of our main achievements in these matters.

2019 started with a Big Bang when the Swedish gaming and gambling re-regulation was initiated on the 1st of January. At midnight that very same day, a customized, Kambi-powered sportsbook was being launched for the Swedish betting operator [ATG](https://www.atg.se/sport#home).

Meanwhile, our Belgian friends at [Napoleon Games](https://www.napoleonsports.be/en/sports/#home) had the ambition of becoming Belgium’s fastest sportsbook. Said and done, we decided to enhance our already existing collaborations and just a few months later Napoleon Games had a brand new look and feel on their sportsbook.

In early 2019, yet another sportsbook collaboration was initiated with Malta-based Rhinoceros, who intended to re-launch the betting-focused brand [MyBet](https://www.mybet.com/en/sport#home) on the German, Austrian and Luxembourgian market. Right before the summer holidays, MyBet’s new sportsbook was up and running.

Further collaborations that have been initiated during 2019 is with Unibet (part of the global operator [Kindred Group](https://www.kindredgroup.com/)) and with Colombian [BetPlay](https://betplay.com.co/apuestas#home). And, before we sheered our glasses on new year’s eve, we decided to take on yet another sportsbook challenge, to be initiated in early 2020.

We closed the year of 2019 by visiting our dearest friends at [Kambi](https://kambi.com/) in London to discuss what’s on the agenda for 2020. The main thing we know for sure on that topic, is that we will continue creating future-friendly and highly performant code, for operators all around the globe, who want to elaborate further on their premium products.
