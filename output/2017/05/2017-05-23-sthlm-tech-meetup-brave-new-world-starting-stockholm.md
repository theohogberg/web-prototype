**STHLM TECH MEETUP** is a monthly meetup group held the first Monday of the month. These events are organised to benefit start-ups or anyone who is interested in technology activities in Stockholm, especially as it pertains to investors and start-ups.

On May 8, 2017 the event was held as usual with a cluster of start-ups and investors but this time it was special because of the huge investment AWS has undertaken to build a data centre in Stockholm. A highlight was the growing number of start-ups present getting funding from investors. This month, the number of start-ups that had previously pitched at **STHLM TECH MEETUP**  and received funding has reached 64.

The event started with Amazon explaining about the data centre in Sweden and the implications, then the VCs introduced themselves and what there are interested in and lastly there was 3 start-ups that pitched their stuff.

**Amazon Data Centre in Sweden**

Amazon gave the following reasons on why they decided to build a data centre in Sweden:

- They believe Sweden’s strong drive for green energy sources (about 56% or so) coincides with the core values at Amazon.
- Lots of potentials in terms of tech companies that require AWS services.
- Geographically they think it makes sense considering Sweden’s location in the Nordic region.

Regarding the implications for this structure, Amazon’s responses where:

- They believe this will resolve a lot of issues around user data and banking regulation.
- That it would increase performance for existing tech business and even help bring more non-tech business on board.
- Creation of more jobs will come from both the physical structure and software application.

**VCs - Sunstone, SEED, Optimizer**

In summary, they talked about their recent investments in start-ups and in particular the growing interest to invest in not so profitable start-ups that provide real world solutions.

**Conclusion**

It was a very exciting event, especially to see that some tech investors are now considering funding start-ups based on the need for their solutions rather than their profitability. There are big expectations for what the future holds for Amazon data centre. Also, it was encouraging to see energy and enthusiasm of start-ups that pitched at the event.

In all, it was a great evening and this event also proves how Stockholm has embraced start-ups with both hands.
