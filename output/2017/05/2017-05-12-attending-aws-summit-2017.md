The decision to open new Amazon Web Services data centres in Sweden has fuelled the notion of the Nordic region as a worldly tech hub. As we at Globalmouth use many AWS services on a daily basis, we decided to attend the summit here in Stockholm again this year.

Besides the free goodies that one would expect at such events (Octocat stickers, yo-yos, ice-cream, fruits and endless tea and coffee), Amazon presented itself as the biggest player in the cloud services arena. There is very little that the company can’t do when it comes to web services, ranging from computing, storage, network and content delivery to the more recent artificial intelligence or Internet of Things products among its large catalogue.

Even though the presentations and breakout sessions only managed to skim the surface of the advertised topics the main takeaways focused on; best practices, checking how others successfully run apps on AWS and getting inspired on trying new solutions for recurrent tech problems.

For us, this will mean improving the way we work with deployment through OpsWorks, optimisation of resources and computing power in EC2 and diversification of our use of S3 storage and likely better scaling and shifting of load too. We will also definitely be looking forward to using Lambda and the server-less stack. the best way ahead seems to be server-less management or provision, automatic scaling with usage and only triggering functions through events (such as changes in data state or via requests to endpoints for example) in order to consume less resources. These things are getting everyone talking about them for a reason!

The delegation of server administration to AWS and the overall running of applications has meant that companies like us can focus our assets on the most important aspect of development: writing better code. For the rest, we can rely on Amazon as a partner that will hopefully bring more innovation and performance in the cloud for years to come.
