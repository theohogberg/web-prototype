[Nordic.js](http://nordicjs.com/) is a two-day conference about _JavaScript and only JavaScript_. Held in **Stockholm, Sweden** at the very hipster Nobelberget - Akzo Nobel's old industrial premises. The conference was geared towards learning new things, being inspired by passionate speakers, meeting new people and most importantly... having fun!

### **These are our 3 main takeaways:**

JavaScript is fast becoming one of, if not **THE** most powerful and important programming language. From its humble beginnings, JavaScript has evolved and matured into something worth being excited about. It's a ubiquitous language with a wide variety of uses. From the conference it was clear that JS is providing solutions to some issues in the modern world of web. How to deal with and create value from real-time data. Supplying consolidated frameworks and libraries such as _graphQL, React, Angular, Vue and Rx.js_ that help put together the pieces of the puzzle when building a stack for a progressive web application.

A strong theme of this years Nordic.js was **community**. With a keynote from _Karolina Sccuzur about 'Building Inclusive Communities'_ and a talk from _Harriet Lawrence_ on how we communicate within the JS community along with how we are perceived from the outside.

In our opinion the JS community only gets stronger with every new member who joins. The community as a whole benefits for every single contribution and involvement from the people, be it finding typos in documentation to spending time writing helpful open source projects. Most importantly the JS community strives to be inclusive and provide equal opportunities to everyone.

With additional scheduled events like techno ping pong, code in the dark, festen after-party, plenty of fika, playful swag and the delectable food trucks on offer during Nordic.js helped to keep the conference _light, fun and digestible._

Our experiences from the conference are all positive and have succeeded in fulfilling our expectations. **Meaning we will be there next year... no doubt!** You can find more information about [the conference on their homepage](http://nordicjs.com/).
