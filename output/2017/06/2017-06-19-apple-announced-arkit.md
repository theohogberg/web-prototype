Apple's annual developer conference, WWDC, was held last week; started with the traditional keynote hosted by Apple CEO Tim Cook on 5th of June. The event was focused around new operating systems as well as new hardware such as new macOS High Sierra, greatly redesigned watchOS 4, new powerful iMac Pro and a smart speaker called HomePod.

One of the most prominent announcement in the conference was the new Augmented Reality (AR) framework called ARKit which will be available with upcoming iOS 11.

AR is a technology which combines physical, real-world environments with digitally generated graphics or sounds to create engaging experiences. In mobile ecosystem, this mostly means catching a Pokemon near your favourite coffee shop or trying IKEA furniture for your living room through your phones camera.

ARKit uses Apple devices' camera and motion hardware to detect your surroundings precisely without any marker or pre setup. It also does some dirty work like calculating lighting and predicting your size in the environment, so your content can be blended smoothly on top of the image from camera.

ARKit is also easy to implement, and will be supported by top engines Unity and Unreal from day one. This means that creating high quality AR applications will be so accessible for developers.

As Tim Cook declared, some of the big companies like IKEA who can benefit from this technology already started working with it. Pokemon Go is updating the game to look better and increase their immersion. Peter Jackson's (director of Lord of the Rings, Hobbit) new AR game studio Wingnut also showcased a mind-blowing demo during the conference.

We already witnessed the high demand for AR applications with the burst in Pokemon GO last year as it reached 28 million daily active users at it's peek. It looks like Apple is trying to seize this market with being the biggest AR platform overnight with the release of iOS 11 this fall.
