When entering the convention, the first thing that we came across was a Batmobile. Honestly, we have no clue how this is connected to the fair but it was really cool and great for selfies. Having been here for a few days now and after having had the chance to interact with a heap of the industry players, we have a few key takeaways that we can take away with us.

1\. What a massive industry this is; when walking down the isles you realize there are many actors in different sectors. Sometimes it can be hard to understand where everyone fits in but it’s evident that the market is huge and keeps on growing.

2\. Virtual reality is hot right now but it seems unclear how the technology will be used to make a big impact for the masses.

3\. Things are going mobile but very slow. The industry seems to be quite conservative and more of the online services need to have an improved mobile experience.

4\. Having face to face talks with many clients and potential clients makes a big difference.

We are already looking forward to returning to ICE next year and wonder how we will reflect on the things we have learnt over the past few days: will the industry become more mobile, will VR find its niche and what new development will the future hold? These are some of the digital transformation questions that Globalmouth is excited to be involved with.
