I have now been at Globalmouth for almost 6 months and it has been an exciting journey. During these months I have learnt to know the company and all the fantastic people working here as well as getting to know our customers and an insight in their very interesting businesses. We have also started a transformation of the company and one part of this is that we today have launched the new web site. The new web site has been a project where the employees have got the full responsibility to create what they think the web should look like. When writing this I have not even seen the final result, but I trust them doing a fantastic job. The first launch is really the first launch. After this we will constantly change, play around, improve and adapt to the current realities and if you follow us you will understand what I mean. One very important part of this is that me and all other employees will spread the learning culture that we think is an essential part of the company culture and we will bring it to you via this blog. Now and then you might also find a guest-blogger telling us his/her perspective of things. I hope you will enjoy this and share.

With the new company, Globalmouth is laying a foundation that will further enhance and evolve our already successful consulting business. The new company, called Globalmouth Consulting AB, will continue our journey by supporting our customers in their digital transformations, enable new business opportunities and optimize our customers’ success by making their business ideas a reality. The consulting business will operate with the same employees and resources as before but with an increased focus on customer service.

My colleagues and I are really looking forward to an exciting and challenging future both in our own transformation as well as our customers’ digital transformation.
