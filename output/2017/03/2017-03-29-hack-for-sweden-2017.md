[Hack for Sweden](http://hackforsweden.se/en/) is an intense 24 hour long hack event held in Stockholm, Sweden. The main objective of the event is to bring attention to the wealth of open data available in Sweden. By utilising the breadth of open data available competitors aim to solve societal, environmental and infrastructure problems that Sweden currently face.

With six main prize categories to aim for competitors can focus their solutions on:

- Hack for Sweden Award (main prize)
- Best Visualisation
- Best Benefit to the Public
- Participants’ prize
- Jury prize
- Best Young Hacker

Following the event, we wanted to ask two of our employees - Robert and Owain - that participated in separate teams, their thoughts from the hackathon.

Q: _What were your thoughts on the Hack for Sweden event?_

R: As a first timer to a hackathon, I got to experience a lot of new things. I didn’t have many expectations before the event, but afterwards I would say that I really like the whole idea of the event and it is always fun to see different solutions to problems.

O: This year was my second time at Hack for Sweden having competed at the previous years event. With the expectations of a well organised event, good food and friendly competition I had from my previous experience, I wasn’t disappointed. The event this year impressively was double the size compared to last year, with around 200 eager competitors all vying for a place on stage to showcase their apps to the jury.

Q: _What was your team contribution to the event?_

R: We had the idea of creating a tool to make it easier for a person or company to see how a business can evolve in the future with the increase of automation in many industries. By correlating the data from Arbetsförmedlingen along with [scientific research](http://stratresearch.se/wp-content/uploads/varannat-jobb-automatiseras.pdf) we determined how likely it was that a profession would become automated in the future. We presented the findings using graphical visualisations in a web based application for users within the business sector to gain insights into professions potentially at high risk of automation.

O: My team included my partner and I going under the name: GeoShepherds. The problem we attempted to solve was surrounding the struggle for light within the urban environment. Light within a city is an important factor affecting the character and rhythm of the urban setting. This is especially the case for a city such as Stockholm that is currently going through a huge construction effort to accommodate the influx in migration, along with the huge variations in daylight hours between winter and summer. We therefore decided to take open building height data from the City of Stockholm and use this to map the shadows cast throughout an entire day during the winter and summer solstices.

Q: _What was your goal for the event/why did you attend?_

R: For me it was more of a fun thing to participate, and I wanted to see how it was to attend a hackathon. My goal was to enter the competition with an open mind and take inspiration from the available information and competitors solutions.

O: My goal was to use the hack event as an opportunity to be creative using openly available data and push myself technically and physically over the 24 hours. I wanted to make it to the group of finalists and present on stage in front of all the competitors and judges which I was really happy to achieve.

Q: _What insights can you give to newcomers?_

R: The main problem we had was struggling to fetch data, so for a newcomer I would say: Prepare your data by reading up on it and try it out, preferably the day before make sure to download a local copy of the data to work with during the event.

O: One insight from the event that I received and I feel is very important is to ensure you at least get your teeth into the data you plan to use before the event. This could be as little as accessing the endpoints of the API to check the responses, downloading csv files or spreadsheets and scrolling through them. The other one, is to make sure you get plenty of sleep the night before the event so you have the stamina to push through the night when stress levels are high.

Q: _Are you going to participate next year?_

R: I am probably going to participate next year. I found my first experience of a hackathon to be really fun and inspiring to be surrounded by innovative and positive solutions.

O: I will look to participate again in this hackathon as well as look around in the tech community in Stockholm to see what other fun hackathons are planned for the coming year.
