**The world is changing as well as people's behaviour and so are businesses. There is a never ending change ongoing and if any business leader thinks his/her company can stand still and not change then that business leader should resign.**

Digitalization happens everywhere. On one side we have robots, androids and artificial intelligence taking over a lot of jobs. On the other side we have previously manual processes and tools being digitized from a normal physical product to something that is now ordered and paid for digitally. There are some jobs requiring less people but on the other hand there are other sectors growing and requiring more staff. This is the trade-off between the employee side and competence side that the business leaders need to understand; that on the one hand they don’t have a salary costs each month instead it they need to take into account depreciation.

In addition to this they also have to understand that people are familiar with things being digitized. Information is digitized, the way we communicate is digitized and our social interactions are digitized. If the business leader doesn’t understand how to communicate with customers, partners and employees soon he/she will not be part of the interaction and dialogue.

Business leaders need to understand that this is a change that sometimes feels very uncomfortable. It is natural to resist change as this implies that you may then lose control amongst different ways of doing things and it can be scary as you might not have the competence.

Finally, the leader’s role is to set an example and encourage others to also challenge themselves to improve. Digitalization happens and therefore the business leaders need to champion the digital transformation process but also understand that they might need to improve their competence themself as well as in the company. Leaders need to care about digitalization to fulfill their business goals.

**So to summarize;**

1. Embrace the digitalization instead of opposing
2. The digitalization changes your view on the finances
3. Adapt to the changing behaviour of the employees and customers
4. You might be a great leader but bring in the competence needed the create the digital transformation
5. Lead the change and be an active part of the digital journey!
