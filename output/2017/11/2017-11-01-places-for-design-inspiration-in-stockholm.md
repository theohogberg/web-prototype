As a front end developer living and working in Stockholm you are surrounded by great design, architecture, urban planning and fashion. The swedes know good design. Scandinavian design is much more than IKEA, these are my 4 favourite places to go for inspiration (in no particular order).

## Moderna Museet

The museum is the national centre for modern and contemporary art. It is a hidden gem located on Skeppsholmen a small secluded island in central Stockholm. Easy to access, open late on Tuesdays and Fridays and with free admission it offers a great place to take some time to saunter around, absorb the atmosphere and become inspired. There is of course a cafe and restaurant to get that all important coffee fix as well as a quiet library where you can get your head down if need be.

## Fotografiska

More than just a museum about photography Fotografiska is a cool place to spend some time. It always has a great atmosphere with interesting exhibitions and a fantastic restaurant. Whilst it costs around 140sek to visit it’s a worthwhile investment. The museum is centrally located on the waterfront and even offers courses to improve your photography skills.

## Nordiska Galleriet

If like me you appreciate the plethora of shapes, sizes and forms of chairs and other furniture the Nordiska Galleriet is a real must! It’s a store that showcases some of Scandinavia's finest interior design firms work as well as international design pieces. Take half an hour to wander around the store and enjoy how some of the world’s best designers solved the problem of how to best make a chair.

## Stockholm Public Library

Functionality is a key aspect to design and architecture and the principles also propagate to web design. Gunnar Asplund’s public library in central Stockholm is functionalism at its best. With the bookshelves fitted around the rotunda, Asplund was able to design a library that importantly stocked books but also created a large space to be able to comfortably sit and enjoy reading. Head over, get a library card and read a book!
